# Step 1: Install necessary libraries
# You can install the required libraries using pip
# !pip install transformers

# Step 2: Load the document
# This example assumes you have a text document. You can adjust it for other formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) if needed.
document_path = 'path/to/your/document.txt'
with open(document_path, 'r') as file:
    document = file.read()

# Step 3: Create an AI model
from transformers import pipeline

# Use a pre-trained model for question answering
nlp = pipeline('question-answering', model='distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad')

# Step 4: Analyze the document
questions = [
    "What is the main topic of the document?",
    "Who is the author of the document?",
    "What are the key points mentioned in the document?"
]

# Analyze the document for each question
for question in questions:
    result = nlp(question=question, context=document)
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}\n")

# Step 5: Output the results
# The answers are already printed in the loop above
