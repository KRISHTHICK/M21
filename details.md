Explanation:
Install Necessary Libraries: The transformers library is used to load pre-trained models.
Load the Document: Reads the document from a specified path.
Create an AI Model: Uses a pre-trained model (distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad) for question answering.
Analyze the Document: Iterates through a list of questions and analyzes the document to find answers.
Output the Results: Prints the answers to the questions.
Steps to Run the Code:
Save the code in a Python file (e.g., document_analysis.py).
Replace 'path/to/your/document.txt' with the actual path to your document.
Ensure you have the transformers library installed (pip install transformers).
Run the Python file (python document_analysis.py).
This example provides a basic framework for document analysis using a pre-trained model. You can customize the questions and model based on your specific needs. Let me know if you need further customization or additional features!
