Gen AI

simple AI agent for document analysis, we can follow these steps:

Set up the environment: Install necessary libraries.
Load the document: Read and preprocess the document.
Create an AI model: Use a pre-trained model or train a new one for document analysis.
Analyze the document: Extract relevant information from the document using the AI model.
Output the results: Display or save the analyzed results.
Here's a basic example using Python and the transformers library from Hugging Face for document analysis:

Python
# Step 1: Set up the environment
!pip install transformers

# Step 2: Load the document
document_path = 'path/to/your/document.txt'
with open(document_path, 'r') as file:
    document = file.read()

# Step 3: Create an AI model
from transformers import pipeline

# Use a pre-trained model for document analysis
nlp = pipeline('question-answering', model='distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad')

# Step 4: Analyze the document
questions = [
    "What is the main topic of the document?",
    "Who is the author of the document?",
    "What are the key points mentioned in the document?"
]

for question in questions:
    result = nlp(question=question, context=document)
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}\n")

# Step 5: Output the results
# The results are already printed in the loop above
Make sure to replace 'path/to/your/document.txt' with the actual path to your document. This example uses a pre-trained question-answering model to analyze the document. You can customize the questions and the model based on your specific needs.
